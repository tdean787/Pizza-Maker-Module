# PizzaStore
 This is my mock up of a website for a generic pizza store.

The highlight of this repo is the pizza building app in index.html. I wanted to practice manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. Another benefit of this project is that it required brushing up on my photo editing skills to make the toppings into the right size and orientation. Most of my time on this has been spent with the JavaScript and attempting to keep everything concise and not repetitive.
