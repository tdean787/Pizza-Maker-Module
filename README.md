# Pizza Maker
 This is my mock up of a website for a generic pizza store. This project was really all for the index.html file in which there is a pseudo-form that lets you design your own pizza. I used this project to develop my understanding of DOM manipulation fundamentals.
 
 A side effect of working on this project is developing photo editing skills which were necessary in order to create custom images for each element in the pizza builder.
 
 Future changes include more customization of each element/topping option, as well as creating new conditionals to allow certain actions to only be allowable if something else has been done on the form.
